# About Me
Hello! I am VC
My current career intrest is Cardiac Ultra-sound Tech. Why you may ask? I want to learn more about the human heart and how it works. This connects to my current lifestyle goals because in order to get into the program I have to have good grades in all my classes, at the moment I am commited to push my self to do so, because I know I am capable of accomplishing that. Skills from this course will help me with my future career because I am learning how to be a professional in my "work enviroment" to help me succeed in the future.
