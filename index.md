My future career is an cardiac Ultrasound tech. I want to join the airforce to help support me with college funds. I see my self in 10 years from now set up for sucess, I think joining the airforce will teach me many things I will need for the future, I want to work hard young and put in the work so later on in my life I do not have to struggle and can enjoy my life. of course there will definitly be bumps in the road but I am sure and committed I can do what it takes to overcome them.
